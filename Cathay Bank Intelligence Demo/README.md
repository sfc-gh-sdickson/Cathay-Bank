## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Raw Tables (Operational Data)
    ‚Üì
Analytics Views (Business Logic)
    ‚Üì
Semantic Model (Intelligence Layer)
    ‚Üì
Natural Language Interface
```

### Key Components

1. **Raw Tables** - Normalized tables representing operational systems
2. **Analytics Views** - Pre-aggregated views with business logic
3. **Semantic Model** - Comprehensive model defining relationships and metrics
4. **Intelligence Agent** - Natural language processing and query generation

## üé® Customization Options

### Adjust Data Volume

Modify the `ROWCOUNT` parameters in `02_load_synthetic.sql`:

```sql
-- Increase customer count to 100,000
FROM TABLE(GENERATOR(ROWCOUNT => 100000))
```

### Add Custom Metrics

Extend the semantic model in `03_semantics.sql`:

```sql
-- Add custom metric for net interest margin
METRICS (
    ...
    (SUM(loan_interest_income) - SUM(deposit_interest_expense)) / 
    SUM(earning_assets) AS net_interest_margin
)
```

### Industry-Specific Modifications

Customize for specific banking segments:
* **Community Banking** - Add local business focus
* **Private Banking** - Enhance wealth management features
* **Commercial Banking** - Add treasury management
* **International Banking** - Include foreign exchange

## üßπ Cleanup

To remove all demo objects:

```sql
-- Run the cleanup script
sql/99_cleanup.sql
```

This will:
- Drop the demo database and all objects
- Remove the demo role
- Delete the demo warehouse

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Table not found" errors**
   - Ensure scripts were run in order
   - Verify you're using `CATHAY_DEMO_ROLE`
   - Check current database context

2. **Agent not returning results**
   - Verify semantic model was created successfully
   - Check role permissions on views
   - Ensure warehouse is running

3. **Slow query performance**
   - Consider using a larger warehouse for initial data load
   - Check if statistics need updating
   - Review query complexity

4. **Data generation timeouts**
   - Increase `STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS`
   - Use a larger warehouse (LARGE or XL)
   - Run data generation in batches

### Getting Help

1. Check Snowflake query history for error details
2. Verify all objects exist in the correct schemas
3. Review agent configuration in Intelligence UI
4. Consult Snowflake documentation

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Best Practices

1. **Clustering Keys** - Add for large tables with common filter patterns
2. **Materialized Views** - Create for complex aggregations
3. **Query Optimization** - Use appropriate warehouse sizes
4. **Caching** - Enable result caching for common queries

### Monitoring

Track performance with:
```sql
-- View long-running queries
SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE DATABASE_NAME = 'CATHAY_BANK_DEMO'
  AND EXECUTION_TIME > 5000
ORDER BY START_TIME DESC;
```
